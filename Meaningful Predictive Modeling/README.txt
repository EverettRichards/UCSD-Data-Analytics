In this directory, you will find my Python Jupyter Notebook in .ipynb and .pdf form, as well as the actual dataset used (student-mat.csv) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

For a concise viewing of the project, I recommend opening the PDF file.

In this project, I used data from two Portuguese schools, which involved various demographic and academic factors for roughly 500 students. I used the methods described below to make predictions for a student's standardized math test scores based on various given factors.

This project involves basic Python data processing and visualization techniques using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and MatPlotLib. I also used the Ridge Regression tools in Scikit-Learn to build a model to predict test scores based on multi-dimensional matrix/vector analysis.
