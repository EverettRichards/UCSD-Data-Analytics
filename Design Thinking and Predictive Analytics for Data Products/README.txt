In this directory, you will find my Jupyter Notebook in .ipynb and .pdf form, as well as the actual dataset used (house-votes-84.DATA).

For a concise viewing of the project, I recommend opening the PDF file.

In this project, I used data from the 1984 session of Congress involving each member's votes on 16 key bills, and I predicted each congress member's political party using data on how they voted on each bill. The accuracy of my model ranges between 98.8% and 99.3% in the binary classification of a testing set.

This project involves basic Python data processing and visualization techniques using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and MatPlotLib, in addition to predictive classification tools using Scikit-Learn's model selection and Logistic Regression tools.
